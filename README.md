# Welcome to the MonoGame tutorial suggestion board

The community is alive and asking for help, tutorials and content to build their next-generation games using [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net)

The purpose of this board is two-fold:

## Capture new requests for content

Based on the feedback from the Game Development community, this board stands as the list of suggested tutorials by the community for any creator to address and comment on. 

## Links and feedback on existing/new content

New suggestions and feedback are welcome from the creator community for resources and tutorials already existing for this content.

## Welcome all

Let's make this game development journey fun and fulfilling for any developer, creator, student or hobbyist to get started building their dreams.
